# What NextUpSports does

My application shows users the next 5 scheduled games/matches for any sports in the world. The accomplishes this by selecting the league that the team plays in from the dropdown list and then selecting the team itself from the accompanying list. The app enables the user to follow their team's schedule for whichever purpose the user would like.
